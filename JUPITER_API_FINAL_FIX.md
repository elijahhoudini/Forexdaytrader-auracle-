🎉 AURACLE TRADING EXECUTION - JUPITER API FULLY FIXED
=====================================================

📅 Date: July 15, 2025
🕐 Time: 02:59 UTC
🔧 Status: FULLY OPERATIONAL

🚀 FINAL JUPITER API FIX SUMMARY:
================================

✅ ISSUE RESOLVED: Transaction signing for Jupiter API swaps
✅ ROOT CAUSE: Incorrect signing method for solders VersionedTransaction
✅ SOLUTION: Proper message serialization and signature population

🔧 TECHNICAL DETAILS:
===================

1. **Original Error:**
   ```
   AttributeError: 'solders.transaction.VersionedTransaction' object has no attribute 'sign'
   ```

2. **Root Cause Analysis:**
   - The `solders` library uses `VersionedTransaction` objects
   - These don't have a direct `sign()` method
   - Must use `populate()` method with pre-signed signatures

3. **Final Fix Applied:**
   ```python
   # Correct signing method for solders VersionedTransaction
   message = transaction.message
   signature = wallet_keypair.sign_message(bytes(message))
   signed_transaction = VersionedTransaction.populate(message, [signature])
   ```

4. **Files Modified:**
   - `/workspaces/Final-/jupiter_api.py` - Fixed transaction signing in both buy and sell methods
